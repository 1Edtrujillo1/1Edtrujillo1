# Hi, IÂ´m Ed ðŸ¤–ðŸ¦¾

IÂ´m a shiny developer with more than 2 years of experience developing end-to-end projects. Along with a real interest in generating insights by finding and transform different patterns into back-end & front-end applications that simplify and automate businesses from startups to big companies. Examples of successful own products are my R package [udeploy](https://github.com/1Edtrujillo1/udeploy), a personalized [docker file](https://hub.docker.com/r/1edtrujillo1/aimagination), and my web application [AImagination](http://ed.aijetv.com/). Moreover, my day-to-day work tools that I enjoy working with are R, python, docker, AWS & git.
